  transpile purescript to nix
  Nix backend for PureScript. Transpile PureScript code to Nix.
  A typical example is parsing of configuration files
  Long-running programs may run out of memory due to the lack of garbage collection and tail recursion.
  If you end up writing long-running programs, like a parser that needs to process very large files,
  you might have to rewrite it in a way that minimizes recursion and allocation.
