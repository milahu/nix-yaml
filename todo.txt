remove all "\r" before parsing

handle space-indents and tab-indents
run two passes of replace
1. replace "\n " with "\r "
2. replace "\n\t" with "\r\t"

then when parsing a block
to dedent the block
find the first indent level
and remove it
example:
a:
  b:
    c
the first indent level are 2 spaces
so the dedented value of a is
b:
  c
